# Chess
My attempt at creating chess in the Unity game engine using C#

Inspired by Sebastian Lague's Chess AI project:

His video: https://youtu.be/U4ogK0MIzqk

His repository: https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-AI

All code is my own.

Download release (located on the right) and run the .exe to play.
